## Overview

In the 5-day mentored Sprint, we engage with a software team, consisting of 10 individuals or less, to assess software for porting activities, develop a 5-day sprint plan, execute a 5-day sprint plan, and develop a retrospective (white paper). The goals of the mentored sprint are to help teams make rapid progress on porting to new hardware and provide guided hands-on experience with new software development tools that are necessary for making the transition. 

To achieve these goals, we dedicate three weeks prior to the sprint to ensure access to a shared development platform that hosts the target hardware, establish processes for building and testing software, and develop an agreeable and realistic sprint plan that is in alignment with larger scale initiatives for your team. During the 5 day sprint, we will work together to execute the sprint plan and will have daily stand-up calls to discuss progress and hurdles and adjust the plan as needed. After the sprint, we will develop a retrospective write-up that covers the progress that was made, noteworthy hurdles that were overcome, any lessons learned, and next steps for the software project.
